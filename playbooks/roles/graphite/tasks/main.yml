# Tasks for role graphite
#
# Overview:
#
# This task is to install "Graphite", or more specifically,
# its constituent parts: carbon and graphite-api.
#
# For our needs at edX, we do not need the full-fledged
# graphite-web, instead opting to use the light graphite-api,
# which can be pointed to by other tools such as Grafana.
#
# Dependencies:
# - common
# - config-encoders
#
